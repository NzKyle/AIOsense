## Description
Based on the idea of an all-in-one sensor AIOsense was born.

The goal is to provide you with a sensor that is modular, affordable and
easy to solder (no SMD) as an alternative for commercially available sensors. We
also focus on upgrade-ability, so you don't have to buy all parts again in case
of a new PCB release. In most cases, this sensor is cheaper and better than the
commercially ones. 

## Available Sensors / Modules

- (RGB)-LED
- Barometer
- Breath VOC equivalent
- Buzzer / Beeper
- COÂ² equivalent
- Humidity sensor
- Light / Illumination sensor
- PIR motion sensor
- Temperature sensor
- mmWave / Radar sensor

**Coming soon:**
- Full Voice Assistant support
- Microphone
- Speaker

All supported sensors & modules are listed in the documentation:
[Sensor Modules](https://aiosense.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sensors/)

### Schematic

You can find the schematic [here](schematic/AIOsense.pdf).

## Power consumption

The power consumption depends on your configuration. On a fully equipped Board (ESP32-C3 + mmWave + PIR + BME280 +
LightSensor) we measured an idle power consumption of **0.45W / 0.09A** some peaks around **0.78W / 0.15A**.

Without a mmWave sensor the idle power consumption is around **0.11W / 0.02A** and peak near **0.45W / 0.09A**.
